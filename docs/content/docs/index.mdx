description: Overview of the OpenVideo Video Editor SDK.
---

Welcome to the OpenVideo documentation! OpenVideo is a framework-agnostic video editor SDK built on the WebCodecs API.

## Quick Start

```ts
import { Studio, Video } from "openvideo";

const studio = new Studio({
  width: 1920,
  height: 1080,
  fps: 30,
});

await studio.ready;

const video = await Video.fromUrl("video.mp4");
await studio.addClip(video);

studio.play();
```

## Core Concepts

### Studio

The Studio is the main container for your video composition. It manages all clips, transitions, timeline, playback, and rendering.

### Clips

Clips are the building blocks - video, image, text, and audio elements positioned on the timeline.

### Timeline

Microsecond-based timeline where all clips are positioned.

### Animations

Property-based animations using keyframes and easing.

### Transitions

Visual effects applied between consecutive clips on the timeline.

## Browser Support

Built on **PixiJS (WebGL)** for rendering and **WebCodecs** for video export.

| Browser | Version | WebGL | WebCodecs | Status         |
| ------- | ------- | ----- | --------- | -------------- |
| Chrome  | 94+     | ✅    | ✅        | Full support   |
| Edge    | 94+     | ✅    | ✅        | Full support   |
| Safari  | 16.4+   | ✅    | ✅        | Full support   |
| Firefox | 100+    | ✅    | ⚠️        | Preview only\* |

\*Firefox has limited WebCodecs support. Preview works via WebGL, but video export may be limited.
