Effects allow you to apply visual filters and modifications to clips.

## Applying Effects

Effects are added by pushing to the `effects` array on a clip.

```ts
import { Video } from "openvideo";

const clip = await Video.fromUrl("video.mp4");

// Add a sepia effect
clip.effects.push({
  id: "my-effect",
  key: "sepia",
  startTime: 0,
  duration: 5e6, // 5 seconds in microseconds
});
```

## Supported Effect Keys

The compositor supports various effect keys, including:

- `brightness`
- `contrast`
- `saturation`
- `blur`
- `hue-rotate`
- `invert`
- `grayscale`
- `sepia`
- `pixelate`

## Managing Effects

Since `effects` is a standard array, you can use standard array methods:

```ts
// Remove an effect
clip.effects = clip.effects.filter(e => e.id !== "my-effect");

// Clear all effects
clip.effects = [];
```
