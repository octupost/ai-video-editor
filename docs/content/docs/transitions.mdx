Transitions create smooth visual effects between two consecutive clips on the timeline. They are applied at the boundary where one clip ends and another begins.

## Basic Transition

```ts
import { Studio, Video, Transition } from "@designcombo/video";

const studio = new Studio({
    width: 1920,
    height: 1080,
    fps: 30,
});

const video1 = await Video.fromUrl("clip1.mp4");
const video2 = await Video.fromUrl("clip2.mp4");

// Add clips and a transition between them
await studio.addClip(video1);
await studio.addClip(video2);

// Add transition from video1 to video2
studio.addTransition({
  from: video1.id,
  to: video2.id,
  type: "fade",
  duration: 1e6, // 1 second in microseconds
});
```

## Transition Types

### Fade
Simple cross-fade between clips.

### Slide
Slide the new clip in from a specified direction (`left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`).

### Zoom
Scale-based transition between clips.

### Blur
Blur the outgoing clip while focusing the incoming clip.

## Overlap Management

DesignCombo automatically handles the visual overlap during the transition. The software ensures that both clips are active and rendered during the transition duration.
